Similar to the previous games in the Street Fighter series, Street Fighter V features a side-scrolling fighting gameplay system. The game also introduces the "V-Gauge", which builds as the player receives attacks and adds three new skills. The game features 16 characters at launch, with four of them being new to the series. A main story mode and 30 additional characters were added through updates and downloadable content. According to Capcom, the game is a PlayStation 4 console exclusive due to both Sony and Capcom having "the same vision for the growth potential in the fighting game space". The game is powered by Unreal Engine 4, and had a beta test prior to its launch. Upon release, the game received mixed reviews, with critics praising the game's graphics and gameplay, but criticizing its lack of content and characters, as well as its technical issues such as broken servers at launch and software bugs. Capcom was expecting the game to sell at least 2 million copies by the end of their fiscal year 2016, a target that was missed, selling only 1.4 million copies as of March 31, 2016. As of June 30, 2022, the game's accumulated sales reached 6.60 million, making it the best selling Street Fighter game on home consoles, surpassing Street Fighter II according to Capcom's Platinum Titles fiscal report.Its update, Street Fighter V: Arcade Edition, was released on January 16, 2018, and was received more positively, with improvements to the user interface and content, in particular its single-player modes and the addition of the much-requested Arcade Mode. A second update, titled Street Fighter V: Champion Edition, includes all fighters, stages, and most of the costumes released through its fourth season. It was released on February 14, 2020, receiving a physical release in the form of the original Street Fighter V disc, containing a voucher code to download the remaining content.},

  abstract = {Super Smash Bros. Ultimate is a 2018 crossover fighting game developed by Bandai Namco Studios and Sora Ltd. and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo Switch. It is the fifth installment in the Super Smash Bros. series, succeeding Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. The game follows the series' traditional style of gameplay: controlling one of the various characters, players must use differing attacks to weaken their opponents and knock them out of an arena. It features a wide variety of game modes, including a campaign for single-player and multiplayer versus modes. Ultimate features 89 playable fighters, including all characters from previous Super Smash Bros. games alongside newcomers. The roster ranges from Nintendo mascots to characters from third-party franchises. Planning for the game had begun by December 2015, with full development starting after the completion of 3DS/Wii U's downloadable content (DLC). Series creator and director Masahiro Sakurai returned along with Bandai Namco Studios and Sora, the studios that developed 3DS/Wii U, with the return of the studios speeding up the preparation process. Sakurai's goal with Ultimate was to include every character from previous games in the series despite the various development and licensing challenges this would present. Several well-known video game musicians contributed to the soundtrack, with Hideki Sakamoto writing the main theme "Lifelight". Nintendo first teased Ultimate in a Nintendo Direct in March 2018 and fully revealed it at E3 2018 the following June. It later received two additional Directs before it was released on December 7, 2018. The game received universal acclaim, with some critics calling it the best of the series. They praised its amount of content and fine-tuning of existing Smash gameplay elements, although its online mode received criticism. Ultimate is the best-selling fighting game of all time, having sold over 28 million copies by March 2022, and is a popular competitive fighting game. The game was supported with downloadable content adding new fighters, stages, and other content from its release until October 2021.},
